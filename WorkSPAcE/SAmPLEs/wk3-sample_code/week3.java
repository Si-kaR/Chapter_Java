Week 3 Lab Activity

In pairs, review Section 6.11 on Method Abstraction and Stepwise Refinement, and answer the following questions:

    1. Explain method hiding / information hiding / encapsulation and why it is useful/valuable.

    2. Explain the concept of stepwise refinement when writing a large program. 
       How was this concept applied to the PrintCalendar problem in the textbook?

    3. Explain the concept of top-down implementation and what role method stubs play in this approach to implementation.

    4. Explain the concept of bottom-up implementation and what role drivers play in this approach to implementation.

    5. Discuss with your partner which approach(es) you have commonly used in your programming assignments and projects to date.

Then, review, download, and test the provided code, PrintCalendar.java, and make modifications to it as follows:

    - Modify the program to print an entire year
    - Modify the program to start the week on Monday rather than Sunday.
